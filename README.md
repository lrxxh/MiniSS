# MiniSS
MiniSS is a simple Minecraft SS tool I am working on to improve my SS skills and maybe be able to help others with screensharing. I will be working on this project in my free time. Feel free to DM me at lrxh#0001 if you have any issues or want to help me improve anything.

# Want to compile the src to an .exe yourself?

1. Download MiniSS_v1.2.1.py and put it in a new folder.

2. After that, open cmd in the same direcotry and type
```pyinstaller MiniSS_v1.2.1.py --onefile```
3. Now you should have multiple folders generated. Click on **Dist**, and inside there should be the .exe.
# Notes!
• The .exe will false flag any antivirus.
• The .py file should never flag anything on any antivirus.
